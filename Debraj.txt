Prof. Chengliang,

    I need a  bit urgent help. I am not sure how to compile the simulator code. Therefore could you please add the following functionalities where the node trigger happens in real-time (most probably in MainFrame.cpp:  str="Triggered Sensor:" + String(pListBox->Count+1)+":   "+str;). Whenever a node (say 99) is triggered we just need it to send a string "99:2012:02:24:14:05:50:854" (means <node id>: <year> :<month>:<date>:<hour>:<minute>:<second>:<millisecond>).  This needs to be sent at port 2004 and IP http://131.96.49.147. Is it please possible to have it today? Thanks. I really appreciate that.

The code for getting system time in C++ is here:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/timeb.h>
#include <time.h>
 
int main()
{
  struct timeb tmb;
  time_t rawtime;
  struct tm * timeinfo;
 
  ftime(&tmb);
  //printf("tmb.time     = %ld (seconds) %ld (minutes) %ld (hour)\n", (tmb.time%60), ((tmb.time/60)%60), (((tmb.time/3600)-5)%24) );
  //printf("tmb.millitm  = %d (mlliseconds)\n", tmb.millitm);
  
  time ( &rawtime );
  timeinfo = localtime ( &rawtime );
  printf ( "The current date/time is: %ld %ld %ld %ld %ld %ld", (timeinfo->tm_year+1900), (timeinfo->tm_mon+1), timeinfo->tm_hour, timeinfo->tm_min, timeinfo->tm_sec, tmb.millitm);
 
  return 0;
}
